Start by, what is global variables?

What is the problem of global variables? you ask?
    => talk about the lifespan and alterablility of their values

Then how can we restrict it? that's where local variables comes into play
    => talk about local variables

does local variables have a downside?
    => talk about local variables lifespan and value reinitialization

then how can we preserve the previous values of a local variable? that's what I am going to talk about next
    => talk about static variables

በቃ ጨርሻለው ሂድ! እንዴ አይደብርክም እንዴ በአንድ አፍ ብለክ ስትሄድ? ባክህ አንድ ያልነገርኩክ ነገር አለ ተረጋጋ
ምንድነዉ ብለክ አጠይቀኝም? ተዉ ጠይቀኝ ተዉ በናትክ፡ ባጠይቀኝም ነግርካለዉ ባከህ አድምጠኝ
    => talk about creating two variables at the same scope (both locally and globally)

then what is going to happen, if I create local variables in two different functions?
    => You know the answer for that, local will always be a local, ካላመንከኝ ግን ላሳይክ
        => show that it is possible to create two different local variables

then what happens if I create a local variable that is identical to global variable, because of scope?
    => show that it is possible?

then what happens if I try to access the variable?
    => show what variable is accessible?

then how can I access the global variable then?
    => talk about the scope operator
