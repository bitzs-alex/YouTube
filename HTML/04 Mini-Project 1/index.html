        <li>
            Preparing home made yeast / እርሾ ማዘጋጀት
            <p>To prepare the yeast, you need the following items</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Teff Flour</li>
                <li>Warm Water</li>
                <li>Small Scaled mixing bowl</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps to Prepare the Ersho</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Add Teff Flour on a mixing bowl.
                    <p><b>NOTE:</b> The amount of Flour you need depend on how many Injera you would like to make.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Gradually add water and mix/stir it until you see thin foam on top</li>
                <li>Seal the bowl/container and Store it in a room temperature for about 3 - 5 days. After 3 - 5 days aerobic yeast will be formed and you will see a murky water which needs to be discarded.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>NOTE:</b> You don't even have to prepare it from scratch. If you have a leftover Leet when you were making Injera previously, you could use it as a yeast.</p>
